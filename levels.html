		<button class="button-ent">ENTITIES</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🚪🏬🔙 Level 0 is a non-linear retail space that resembles the back rooms, with each room being unique but sharing yellowed wallpaper, damp carpet, and inconsistent fluorescent lighting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>🧭📡 Navigation is difficult in this linearly distorted space as walking in a straight line leads to different rooms, and compasses, GPS, and radio communications do not function.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>👥👻 No life is present in Level 0, and no wanderer has made contact, leading us to believe that many have perished from dehydration, starvation, and psychological trauma, with no corpses found. We recommend entering Level 0 alone to prevent separation until the level is exited.</p>

		<h1>Level 1</h1>
		<button class="button-info">INFO</button>

		<button class="button-ent">SUPPLIES</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🏢 Level 1 is a warehouse with concrete walls and floors, dim lights, and a low-hanging fog with no discernible source. It possesses a consistent supply of water and electricity, but beware of hostile entities that may appear when the lights go out. Crates of supplies appear and disappear randomly, and crude paintings and drawings appear on the walls and floors.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>💡👻 The fluorescent lights at any time can flicker and turn off for minutes or even hours. When this occurs, hostile entities may appear. These entities rarely attack in groups and tend to avoid light. If the lights turn off, It is strongly advised to try and navigate your steps, Try and avoid any strange noises and then find a room, Make sure to bring a light source with you.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>📦💊 Crates of supplies appear and disappear randomly within the Level, often containing a mixture of vital items (food, Almond Water, batteries, tarps, weaponry, clothing, medical supplies) and nonsensical objects (assorted car parts, boxes of crayons, used syringes, partially burned paper, live mice, mice in a catatonic state that have been injected with unknown substances, shoelaces, loose change, bundles of human hair). The crates should be approached with caution due to their contents, but are a valuable resource.</p>

		<button class="button-nav">NAVIGATION</button>
		<button class="button-ent">ENTITIES</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🚪🕳️ Level 2 is a network of dark, grey, concrete maintenance tunnels that seem to stretch on for millions of miles. The walls are lined with pipes and ventilation ducts, which often contain a thick, viscous black liquid. Doors can sometimes be found, but most are locked or lead to dead ends. These rooms usually contain shelves with random assortments of objects, occasionally computers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>🌡️ In some areas of Level 2, the heat can become unbearable, reaching 43°C (110°F) or higher. This is usually in places where the machinery is loudest, typically at the ends of hallways.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>👹 The Entities found on this Level are some of the most dangerous in The Backrooms. Crawlers can be heard making noises from the vents. Mark can be found in employee bathrooms. Other beings present include Smilers, Child Facelings, Clumps, Hounds, Male Deathmoths, Wretches, Plague Goblins, Bursters, and Skin-Stealers. The only thing you need to know, and can know, is to run away the moment you see one.</p>

		<h1>Level 3</h1>
		<button class="button-info">INFO</button>
		<button class="button-nav">NAVIGATION</button>
		<button class="button-ent">MATERIAL</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🚪🌀 Level 3 consists of a series of twisting hallways with randomly segmented rooms, similar to Level 0. The hallways are narrow, enclosed, and extremely loud with the noises of machinery. Wanderers may need to bend, hunch, crawl, or walk sideways to navigate through them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>🌎 Level 3 is one of the largest levels in the Backrooms, estimated at around 350 million square miles (~563 million square kilometers). This makes it difficult to encounter other wanderers, so it's recommended to enter Level 3 only if you're properly prepared to defend yourself as it's unlikely that any help will come if needed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>🧱 The walls are dusty brown bricks covered in copper pipes and mechanical components, while the floors are even dustier with grey tiles. The ceiling is entirely made of metal.</p>

		<h1>Level 4 <---- You Are Here</h1>
		<button class="button-info">INFO</button>
		<button class="button-nav">NAVIGATION</button>
		<button class="button-ent">DIRECTIONS</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🚪🏢 Level 4 of the Backrooms resembles an empty office building with few entities, making it a safe place to stock up on supplies such as Almond Water from vending machines, fountains, and water coolers. Some rooms have windows, but they are usually blacked out and considered traps. This level is a hub for various groups and communities, including the M.E.G. Base Omega, Amor Incrementum, and T.B.D. group.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>👥 M.E.G. Base Omega is the second main base of the Major Explorer Group, located near the entrances of Level 5 and 6 and heavily guarded. Amor Incrementum is a religious cult that worships agriculture and harvests various species of mold from walls in Level 0 and 1. They are hostile and trade only with religious objects. T.B.D. group hoards various objects and items for themselves and only trade for strange objects with no function.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>🔍 To reach Level 4, one can No-Clip into a wall in The Hub, use elevators from Level 3, find an unlocked door on Level 2, or fall through The Pit in Level 283, which may teleport divers through the ceiling of Level 4. This level has occasional exits that lead to Level 5 and 6, usually in the form of office-style stairways, elevators, or rarely, stairs leading to a basement that goes to Level 71.</p>

		<button class="button-ent">FURTHER INFO</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🏨 Level 5 is an infinite hotel complex, with many rooms and halls. The Level itself seems to have been constructed in the 1930s, with furniture dating back to 1920. There are three (3) main areas in Level 5 that are fully accessible.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section navigation">
			<p>🛋️ From what we have explored The surroundings of Level 5 are littered with decorations and furniture from the early 20th century, The Main Hall being the most object-populated area of Level 5. The Level is mostly clean with little dust and dirt lingering on surfaces. It seems to clean itself, as unclean spots seem to disappear only a few minutes after. The oddly pristine floors and well-cared areas make Level 5 utterly unsettling, compared to other Levels close by. Smooth jazz plays quietly throughout the halls via vintage turntables and vintage speakers hooked up to a sound system throughout the Level. The choice and switching of music seem to be random and out of place, it is unknown how this feat is completed.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section entities">
			<p>❓ There is still more questions as The Beverly Room and The Boiler Room have yet to be explored. Proceed with caution as you enter this level; it is recommended to stay near the main area.</p>

		<h1>Level 6</h1>
		<button class="button-info">WARNING</button>
		<div class="section info">
			<p>🔦⚠️ It is important to note that despite the complete darkness of Level 6, bringing a light source may not be helpful in navigating the level. It is believed that the darkness is supernatural in nature, and no light sources brought into the level have been able to penetrate it. It is also advised that caution be taken when exploring this level, as the tight and unfamiliar corridors can be disorienting and dangerous. There have been reports of entities in Level 6, but no concrete evidence has been found.</p>
