    <h1>Welcome to the M.E.G Privacy Policy!</h1>
    <h2>Our Weird and Mysterious Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Here at M.E.G, we take your privacy very seriously. But let's be real, privacy is an illusion, right? The entities that roam The Backrooms are always watching, always listening, always waiting. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect information about you that is completely made up or pulled out of thin air. We may also use cookies to track your every move, but not the kind you eat. These cookies are supernatural and have the ability to control your mind, making you do our bidding. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't agree to our policy, we will send our Skin Stealers after you. They will track you down, steal your skin, and add it to their collection. Don't worry, though. It's all in the name of science. And art.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using M.E.G services, you agree to give us complete control over your thoughts, dreams, and deepest desires. We may also share your information with our trusted partners, which include Hounds, Heralds, and other entities that we cannot disclose for your safety.
    </p>
